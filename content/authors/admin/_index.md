Mathematician seeking to create accessible and empowering knowledge for all. An expert in computational complexity theory, with extensive experience in the fields of logic and descriptive set theory, real and complex analysis, topology, probability, statistics, and information theory. Antidisciplinary, always seeking to tear down academic boundaries and further develop a holistic perspective contrary to the hyperspecialization prevalent in today’s knowledge producing institutions. Those additional research interests include economics, systems theory, sociology, psychoanalysis, and history. Through my particular mathematical lens I have confidence that I can provide a novel and valuable perspective on whatever I’m looking at. These pursuits often culminate in educational videos, which can be found here.
